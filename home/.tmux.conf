# This configuration file binds many of the common GNU screen key bindings to
# appropriate tmux key bindings. Note that for some key bindings there is no
# tmux analogue and also that this set omits binding some commands available in
# tmux but not in screen.
#
# Note this is only a selection of key bindings and they are in addition to the
# normal tmux key bindings. This is intended as an example not as to be used
# as-is.

# Set the prefix to ^A.
unbind C-b
set -g prefix C-a
bind a send-prefix

# Move around panes with HJKL
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R

# Last window
bind C-a last-window

# Vim has a terribly annoying escape time without this
set -s escape-time 0

# Start window numbering at 1
set -g base-index 1
set -g pane-base-index 1

# Colors
set -g status-bg colour234
set -g status-fg colour15

# More scrollback
set -g history-limit 10000

# Vi keys in scrollback
set-window-option -g mode-keys vi

# Enable windows renumbering
set-option -g renumber-windows on

##CLIPBOARD selection integration
##Requires prefix key before the command key
#Copy tmux paste buffer to CLIPBOARD
bind C-c run "tmux show-buffer | xsel -i -b"
#Copy CLIPBOARD to tmux paste buffer and paste tmux paste buffer
bind C-v run "tmux set-buffer -- \"$(xsel -o -b)\"; tmux paste-buffer"
